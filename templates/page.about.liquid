        <h2>Why Hydration Matters</h2>
        <p>
            Mild dehydration—just a 2% loss of fluids—can impair memory, mood, concentration and reaction
            time【270766539831704†L302-L307】. Simply adding a few glasses of water to your day can improve
            cognitive function and help stabilise your emotions【270766539831704†L302-L307】. Dehydration
            also slows circulation and reduces oxygen flow, leaving you tired and unfocused; staying
            hydrated keeps your heart and brain operating efficiently【270766539831704†L321-L326】.
        </p>
        <p>
            Good hydration supports digestive harmony by aiding the breakdown of fibre and preventing
            discomfort such as bloating or heartburn【270766539831704†L311-L315】. It lubricates your
            joints, reducing friction and pain【270766539831704†L344-L349】, and assists in regulating
            your body temperature during activity or hot weather【270766539831704†L354-L358】. Proper
            hydration is also linked to a healthier metabolism and can aid in weight management【270766539831704†L330-L341】.
